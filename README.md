I have completed all the PentesterLab (Labs) & HTB Certified Bug Bounty Hunter and also INE eWPTX V2. but to respecting their privacy, I'm not making the notes/solutions public.
My end goal is to learn techniques from all over the places so that I can give my best in any pentesting scenario.

Both CPTS & CBBH are coming too. IMO CPTS way more harder than OSCP [but it will teach you in depth everything]
